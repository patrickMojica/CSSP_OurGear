common_name: This column likely stores the common name or identifier for a product.
manufacturer: This column stores the manufacturer of the product.
product_id: This column likely stores a unique identifier for each product.
description: This column stores a description of the product.
owner: This column may store information about the owner of the product.
Each row in this table would represent a specific product, with values for each of these properties.

Please generate a query string that will insert a new column to the leftmost side, named item_id, which cannot be null and automatically increments whenever a new row is added ensuring that each row has a unique value for item_id

ChatGPT
To add a new column named item_id to the leftmost side of the table and ensure that it cannot be null and automatically increments for each new row, you can follow these steps:

First, alter the table to add the new column.
Then, update the new column to set it as a primary key.
Finally, set the column to be of type SERIAL, which automatically increments and ensures uniqueness.
Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE your_table_name
ADD COLUMN item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY;
Replace your_table_name with the actual name of your table. This query will add a new column named item_id to the leftmost side of the table, ensuring it cannot be null and automatically increments for each new row, ensuring uniqueness. The SERIAL type automatically generates a unique integer for each row inserted.
